Task 1: Age-Based Admission Fee
--------------------------------
Scenario: You are developing a ticketing system for a museum. The admission fee is determined based on the visitor's age:

Free admission for children under 5 years old.
A discounted fee of $10 for visitors aged between 5 and 12 years.
The full price of $20 for visitors aged 13 years and above.

Task:
Assume a variable age holds the visitor's age.
Use a ternary operator to calculate the admission fee and store it in a variable fee.

Example Output : 
----------------
	The Admission fee is 10$

Task 2: Greeting Based on Time of Day
--------------------------------------
Scenario: You are developing a website that greets visitors based on the current time of day. The greeting changes as follows:

"Good Morning" if the time is between 5:00 AM and 11:59 AM. 
"Good Afternoon" if the time is between 12:00 PM and 5:59 PM.
"Good Evening" if the time is between 6:00 PM and 9:59 PM.
"Good Night" if the time is between 10:00 PM and 4:59 AM.
Task:

Assume a variable hour holds the current hour in 24-hour format.
Use a ternary operator to determine the appropriate greeting and store it in a variable greeting.
Output the greeting.


Example Output
---------------
	Good Morning

Task 3: Check if a Number is Positive, Negative, or Zero
----------------------------------------------------------
Scenario: You need to determine whether a given number is positive, negative, or zero using nested ternary operators.

Task:

Assume a variable number holds the value of the number you want to check.
Use nested ternary operators to determine if the number is positive, negative, or zero.
Store the result in a variable result and output it.

var number = -1;


Example Output
--------------
	The Number is Positive



4. Scenario: Online Library Membership
---------------------------------------
Context: An online library offers different levels of membership. Depending on the type of membership, users have access to different resources:

Basic Membership: Access to only free books.

Standard Membership: Access to free books and discounted paid books.

Premium Membership: Access to all books, including exclusive content.

Question: Imagine you have a variable that stores a user’s membership type. Using conditional statements, determine what resources the user can access and display a message indicating their access level. Consider how you would handle a situation where the membership type is invalid.

5. Scenario: E-Commerce Discount Application
---------------------------------------------
Context: An e-commerce platform applies discounts based on the user's membership status and the total purchase amount:

Regular Customers: No discount for purchases under $100. A 5% discount for purchases between $100 and $500. A 10% discount for purchases over $500.

VIP Customers: A 10% discount for purchases under $100. A 15% discount for purchases between $100 and $500. A 20% discount for purchases over $500.

Question: Suppose you have variables that represent a user’s membership status and purchase amount. Use conditional statements to determine the final price after applying the appropriate discount. Think about how to handle invalid inputs, such as negative purchase amounts or unrecognized membership statuses.

6. Scenario: Academic Scholarship Eligibility
----------------------------------------------
Context: A university offers scholarships to students based on their GPA and extracurricular involvement:

Merit-Based Scholarship: Requires a GPA of 3.5 or higher.

Leadership Scholarship: Requires active participation in at least two extracurricular activities and a GPA of 3.0 or higher.

Community Service Scholarship: Requires 100 or more hours of community service and a GPA of 2.5 or higher.

Question: Given variables that store a student's GPA, number of extracurricular activities, and community service hours, use conditional statements to determine which scholarships the student is eligible for. Consider scenarios where a student qualifies for multiple scholarships or none.

7. Scenario: Movie Ticket Pricing
----------------------------------
Context: A movie theater charges different prices based on the day of the week and the customer's age:

Weekdays: Standard price of $12. Seniors (65 and older) and children (under 12) receive a 50% discount.

Weekends: Standard price of $15. Seniors and children receive a 30% discount.

Question: Assume you have variables for the day of the week and the customer’s age. Use conditional statements to determine the correct ticket price. Consider how to handle situations where the day or age is invalid.

8. Scenario: Event Registration Validation
-------------------------------------------
Context: An event registration system needs to validate user inputs before confirming their registration:

The user must be 18 years or older to register.

The event allows a maximum of 100 participants. If the event is full, no more registrations are accepted.

The user must provide a valid email address.

Question: You have variables for the user’s age, the number of participants already registered, and their email address. Use conditional statements to validate whether the user can register for the event. Think about how to handle cases where some or all conditions are not met.

9.Scenario: Tea Stall Customer Order Processing
----------------------------------------------
Context: You are managing a small tea stall that offers different types of tea. The stall has three main types of tea:

Regular Tea: Costs ₹15 per cup.
Masala Tea: Costs ₹20 per cup.
Ginger Tea: Costs ₹25 per cup.
The stall also offers add-ons that customers can choose to enhance their tea:

Extra Sugar: Adds ₹2.50 per cup.
Extra Milk: Adds ₹5 per cup.
No Add-ons: No additional cost.

Scenario Description:
A customer approaches the stall and places an order for one type of tea with or without add-ons. You need to calculate the total price based on the customer’s choices and provide them with the final cost.

Inputs:
Tea Type: The type of tea the customer wants to order ("Regular", "Masala", or "Ginger").
Add-On: The additional option the customer selects ("Extra Sugar", "Extra Milk", or "No Add-ons").

Outputs:
Total Price: The final amount the customer needs to pay, based on their tea selection and chosen add-on.
Explanation:
Determine the Base Price:
First, identify the type of tea the customer orders. The base price is determined by this choice:
If the customer orders Regular Tea, the base price is ₹15.
If the customer orders Masala Tea, the base price is ₹20.
If the customer orders Ginger Tea, the base price is ₹25.

Calculate Add-On Costs:
Next, consider the add-on the customer chooses:
If the customer selects Extra Sugar, add ₹2.50 to the base price.
If the customer selects Extra Milk, add ₹5 to the base price.
If the customer selects No Add-ons, no additional cost is added.

Compute the Total Price:
Add the cost of the add-on (if any) to the base price of the selected tea.
Provide the Output:
The final output should be the total price that the customer needs to pay.
Example:
Example 1:

Input:

Tea Type: "Regular"
Add-On: "Extra Sugar"
Calculation:

Base Price for Regular Tea: ₹15
Add-On Cost for Extra Sugar: ₹2.50
Total Price: ₹15 + ₹2.50 = ₹17.50
Output:

Total Price: ₹17.50
Example 2:

Input:

Tea Type: "Ginger"
Add-On: "No Add-ons"
Calculation:

Base Price for Ginger Tea: ₹25
Add-On Cost for No Add-ons: ₹0.00
Total Price: ₹25 + ₹0.00 = ₹25
Output:

Total Price: ₹25
This scenario helps in understanding how to apply conditional statements to real-life situations where a decision must be made based on user input, leading to a basic output that directly reflects the choices made by the customer.
